# I3-Setup

/!\ This project is currently in writing, and wasn't properly tested yet ! /!\

This is just my own configurations for my personnal setup

Feel free to use it if you want, but make sure to review the `init.sh` script, as well as each tool's dedicated folder and it's config files, if you do, as it might install or setup stuff you might not want.

The configurations might also be strongly opinionated (custom keybinds for i3 specific actions, disabled modules in polybar because i personnaly don't have a use for them, preinstalling and preconfiguring neovim plugins according to my own preferences, stuff like that). 

As previously stated, it's primarly for my own use, i don't plan to make it more "general use" in any way

## How to use

Just run the `init.sh` script with sudo (as it messes with apt packages and file permissions *- another good reason to review it before executing it :D*) :

```sh
$ sudo sh ./init.sh
```
